The final dashboard is deployed on Heroku [here](https://ma705bostonuniversities.herokuapp.com).

## Dashboard Description

In this project, Iâ€™m interested in seeing the rental market of several selected areas (zip codes) in Massachusetts. The rental market has been going through quite a lot of changes since covid break, and different cities and areas may have different trends due to the remote working and lock down during in the past. These five different zip codes are associated with different cities covering from the east to the west of Massachusetts. 


This dashboard shows the total rentals in different cities and years, and average price of rentals in each month, and the top ten average rental price in combination with the corresponding population and household income in different format. By using three different filters, the users can easily check out the rental market of homes with different number of bedrooms in different cities and years, and have a good understanding of the rental market since the covid break.
